# Code Book

This code book describes the features in the `tidydata.txt`.

## Grouping Variables

The tidy dataset contains 66 variables averages for each combinations of the following two grouping variables

* `subject` - ID for each of the 30 subjects who performed the activities
* `activity` - The type of activity performed when the corresponding
measurements were taken. The following activities were performed: WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING, DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
 
## Variables 

  For each subject and activity combination the average for each of the 66 measurements (containing mean and standard deviation values) was calculated.
